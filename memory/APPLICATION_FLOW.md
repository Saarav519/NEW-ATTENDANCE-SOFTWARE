Daily Duty Amount = Monthly CTC ÷ Working Days in Month
Total Duty Earned = Sum of (daily_duty_amount for each present day)
Half Day = 50% of Daily Duty Amount

SALARY DISTRIBUTION (Proportional):
───────────────────────────────────
If employee earns 70% of month:
  Basic = (Basic Component) × 0.70
  HRA = (HRA Component) × 0.70
  DA = (DA Component) × 0.70
  ... and so on

NET PAY FORMULA:
────────────────
Net Pay = Total Duty Earned 
        + Attendance Conveyance (from daily attendance)
        + Extra Conveyance (approved bills)
        + Audit Expenses (approved audit claims)
        - Advance Deduction

CASH OUT FOR SALARY:
────────────────────
Salary Cash Out = Total Duty Earned + Attendance Conveyance - Advance
(Bills & Audit Expenses have separate Cash Out entries to avoid double counting)
